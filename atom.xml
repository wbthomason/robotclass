    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to ENGR 1501: Introduction to Aerial Robotics. This post will go over the course&rsquo;s objectives, expectations, and structure, discuss some motivations for studying robotics, and give a brief overview of the structure of the quadcopter we&rsquo;ll be building in the first few weeks. We&rsquo;ll get started with the syllabus.</p>

<h3>Syllabus:</h3>

<p>The syllabus can be found <a href="http://1drv.ms/1BhxqNa">here</a>; this will be where the most up to date version lives throughout the semester. Aside from the topic listing, which we&rsquo;ll discuss later, the most important parts of the syllabus can be summed up as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intent of the course:</strong> To provide students with a basic survey of modern robotics, in hopes of sparking interest in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Structure of the course:</strong> Biweekly meetings on Tuesdays, which will typically consist of a short review of the week&rsquo;s material followed by time to work construction/modification of the quadrotor. The exact balance of these components will vary by week as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Course requirements:</strong> No textbook, but some programming experience - preferably in C/C++, preferably dealing with embedded hardware - is required. Any prior experience with robotics is welcomed, although students with such experience are cautioned that this is very much an introductory course.</li>
<li><strong>Course grading:</strong> The course is graded Pass/Fail, with grades being calculated as follows: 20% from a quiz on the week&rsquo;s material, given at the beginning of each class meeting, the remaining 80% from the successful completion of the quadrotor project, and a possible 10% bonus for participating in the final obstacle course challenge (assuming that this happens).</li>
</ul>
